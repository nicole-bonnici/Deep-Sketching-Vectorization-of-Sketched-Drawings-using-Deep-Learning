# Deep-Sketching-Vectorization-of-Sketched-Drawings-using-Deep-Learning
Repository for the code and dataset used for the dissertaion Deep Sketching: Vectorization of Sketched Drawings using Deep Learning


The folder Dataset contains the code for aligning and augmenting the data, as well as the ground truths drawn by the author.//
The folder FCNN contains the file to train the convolutional neural network and the code to clean drawings with the trained model.//
The folder Vectorization contains the code to cnvert raster images to their vector counter parts.//
The folder Future work contains the regularaization loss function based on gabor filters that could be further developed.//
Model.h5 is the trained model//

Each folder contains a list of enviorments required.
